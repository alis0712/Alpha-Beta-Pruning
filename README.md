# Alpha-Beta-Pruning

In this project I created a script that performed α-β pruning on path finding. Heap data structure was used to implement the α-β pruning

The results were as follows:

Based on the results we can see that with α-β pruning the enemy's path is no longer a linear path from A to B but rather a non-linear one which makes the enemy pathing more interesting.
